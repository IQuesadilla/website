            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Isaac Quezada. I spend most of my time elbows deep in technology, either programming, robots, or computers. I am part of an FRC team, where I mainly do electrical for the robot but help with the programming team as much as possible. I do lots of programming in my free time, along with a moderate amount of electrical things. I work with computers and IT all the time, between my own free time and for work. I enjoy math and problem solving as well. I also go to an LCMS church every Sunday and help out with service work through church and school as well.

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                I was born in Marshaltown, Iowa on June 05, 2003. Shortly after, I moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, where I grew up. Over the summer before 6th Grade, I moved from Fort Wayne to St. Charles, Missouri. I have so far lived in St. Charles ever since, soon planning to move to Albuquerque, NM.

            <h2>Schooling</h2>
            <p>
                I have gone to private schools my entire life. Starting in kindergarten, I went to Suburban Bethlehem Lutheran School in Fort Wayne. In Missouri, I went to Immanuel Lutheran St. Charles for the rest of Middle School and Lutheran High School of St. Charles County for all of High School. For my last year of High School, I spent every morning at Lewis and Clark, learning Computer Software Development.

            <p>
                My first job was at an IT shop in Chesterfield, Missouri during the summer before my Junior year. It is named "Red Leaf IT Asset Recovery and Recycling". I worked there the following summer, along with a frozen custard shop called "Doozle's Frozen Custard". I worked Doozle's throuh the school year as well. For the summer after my Senior year, I worked at Red Leaf for the third summer in a row.
