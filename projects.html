            <h2>Physics Library Front-End</h2>
            <p>
                A potential front end for a physics library (Bullet, ODE, etc). Currently working with Bullet,
                I will need to try some others and decide. Eventually, it will probably work with the Animation
                Software as a kind of a front end. It will definitely depend on the 3D GL Tools and the DAE
                Loader to mature before it can.

            <h2>3D GL Tools</h2>
            <p>
                A few different tools helpful for generic 3D applications, targeted at OpenGL (some are
                specific to OpenGL and GLSL). Currently this includes a library for loading and using OpenGL GLSL 
                shaders and a library for controlling the camera/viewport. Plans are to add support for animations
                and more precise control to the camera library.

            <h2>Animation Software</h2>
            <p>
                The idea is a very basic text only animation software. There is no front end, it simply reads a
                file of instructions and does what it is told to do. This is simply a concept at this point,
                however work on it will begin shortly. It depends on some of the other projects to become more
                mature first before it can become much more than a concept.

        <div>
            <h2>DAE Loader Library</h2>
            <p>
                A library for loading Collada/Collada FX/Collada Physics .dae files. The goal is to
                be able to do more than simply load the files and have the programmer deal with them. It will
                load the files into a custom object class, which can then easily be dealt with by the
                programmer. This can be imported by the programmer into any physics/game engine, or into a
                custom program.
